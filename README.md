#Happy New Year To all Dev's....😎

🎉 Cheers to 2025! 🎉
Welcome the new year—turns out my compiler is more excited than I am. 😄

💻 Goals for 2025:

Write code that works... on the first try (a developer can dream, right? 🤷‍♂).
Debug life and code with fewer if-else moments.
Add more features to my career than my GitHub repos. 🚀
Let’s make 2025 the year of no merge conflicts in both code and life! Wishing everyone a stack overflow of happiness and success! 🌟
